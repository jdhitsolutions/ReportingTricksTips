![PowerShell](images/powershell-emoji.png)

My presentation and demo material for my session that was part of the [PowerShell 1-Day Conference](https://petri.com/conferences/get-it-powershell-1-day-virtual-conference) from [Petri.com](https://petri.com/). Use the [Discussions](https://github.com/jdhitsolutions/ReportingTricksTips/discussions) section of this repository for follow-up questions or comments.

## Abstract

It doesn't matter if you are using PowerShell to check on processes running on several servers, working with Microsoft 365 accounts, searching Active Directory, or managing Hyper-V virtual machines. You will want to create meaningful reports. This could be as simple as a nicely formatted table to a rich HTML file. In this session, you'll learn proper techniques for generating meaningful reports along with many tips and tricks.

## Modules

You will want to install these modules from the PowerShell Gallery if you want to try the demonstrations yourself.
