These logs are in addition to those provided by the operating system.</td></tr>
<tr><td>HTTP Redirection</td><td>Web-Http-Redirect</td><td>HTTP Redirection provides support to redirect user requests to a specific destination. Use HTTP redirection whenever you want customers who might use one URL to actually end up at another URL.

Pick an appropriate authentication scheme based upon the role of the server. Filter all incoming requests, rejecting without processing requests that match user defined values, or restrict requests based on originating address space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Server Side Includes</td><td>Web-Includes</td><td>Server Side Includes (SSI) is a scripting language used to dynamically generate HTML pages.

<tr><td>URL Authorization</td><td>Web-Url-Auth</td><td>URL Authorization allows you to create rules that restrict access to Web content. You can bind these rules to users, groups, or HTTP header verbs. By configuring URL authorization rules, you can prevent employees who are not members of certain groups from accessing content or interacting with Web pages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Web Server</td><td>Web-WebServer</td><td>Web Server provides support for HTML Web sites and optional support for ASP.NET, ASP, and Web server extensions.

<tr><td>Windows Authentication</td><td>Web-Windows-Auth</td><td>Windows authentication is a low cost authentication solution for internal Web sites. This authentication scheme allows administrators in a Windows domain to take advantage of the domain infrastructure for authenticating users. Do not use Windows authentication if users who must be authenticated access your Web site from behind firewalls and proxy servers.</td></tr>
